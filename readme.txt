== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can only see the browser redirection in the backend, where the other options? =

You are using the standard free option – you need to get the Pro version for the other options.

= My site now gives an error like “too many redirects"... =

The redirection is looping. What this means is that you have a redirect on that page and have another redirect conflicting. This could be a htaccess file error, or an SEO plugin conflict. Try temporarily disabling your htaccess or other plugins till your site loads fine so you can find the culprit.

= All browsers/countries/devices go the same redirect page. =

Check your Source Redirect Site Plugin settings, each tab has an option to redirect all types – make sure that is set to “no” to enable individual redirection.

= How do I make the redirect back to normal for Mobile users? =

You need to create a link on your site for mobile users, with the target URL as follows: http://[YOURSITE]/?redirect_bypass=1 this will let mobile users return to the base normal looking site.
